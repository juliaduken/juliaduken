## Hi, I'm Julia 👋🏼💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliaduken/juliaduken/master/github-header.png" alt="banner that says Julia Duken, policy analyst & python enthusiast, with colorful blocks.">

I'm currently working on completing my Master's in Public Policy and Management with an emphasis on policy analysis at Carnegie Mellon University. My goal for learning Python is to conduct data analysis and program evaluation, however, to keep up to speed I've created a lot of personal projects. I'm looking for a full time position in May 2025 and am hoping to continue building on my coding skills while advancing health equity in the US.
