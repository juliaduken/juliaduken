## About Me
I'm currently working on completing my Master's in Public Policy and Management with an emphasis on policy analysis at Carnegie Mellon University. My goal for learning Python is to conduct data analysis and program evaluation, however, to keep up to speed I've created a lot of personal projects. Excited to share a few here!

## About My Work
I've been using Python for a while for different projects, especially data analysis and visualization. My undertakings showcased here were intended to build my ability to create and organize more complex programs and are strictly for fun (while building mastery!).

After following some tutorials, my first completed concept of a platformer was _peaceful-platformer_. While this game is complete, I wouldn't necessarily call it a game. The structure of the mechanisms behind tracking player advancement in the level made adding features difficult. I trouble-shooted this in the branch _camera_, but moved on to another project afterward. 

I decided I wanted to take a more managable swing at a game, so I recreated Wordle by the NYT in _guess-the-word_. It is a great example of how far I've grown since _peaceful-platformer_. I think my execution and organization really improved with what I learned through that process. I am proud of both projects and my growth as a programmer!
